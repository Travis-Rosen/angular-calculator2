# angular-calculator2

## Installation & Running the application

1. Clone repo/download zip
2. Delete node-modules if present upon cloning/downloading. Ensure that you have navigated to the '/calculator-app' directory in terminal. (ex. 'C../angular-calculator2/calculator-app') and reinstall node modules with 'npm install --save'.
3. In order for the application to connect to the database, we need to run two separate commands from two terminals.

    npm start

    node ./server/app.js

    *These commands must be ran from the '/calculator-app' directory

4. The application should be running on http://localhost:4200/ 

    In the terminal that started the server, it will display api responses.
